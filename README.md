## Paper Overview
This repository contains data and code for the analysis of the distribution of
Toronto's city-owned street trees. In particular, the relationship between neighborhood
income and street tree prevalence and size is explored. The neighborhoods in question
are Toronto's 25 municipal voting wards. The analysis is conducted using the Street Tree 
and City Wards datasets pulled from the City of Toronto Open Portal. In the analysis,
I conclude that Toronto's wealthiest wards have disproportionately many street trees
per square kilometer when compared with the cities poorest wards. This disparity is
even greater in the case of large street trees. These results are consistent with
literature suggesting that Canadian cities, and Toronto in particular, allocate
government resources unequally to neighborhoods.

## File Structure
'Outputs' includes files used to generate the analysis paper, including a .bib and
R Markdown file, as well as the paper itself. 'Inputs' includes the data used in the
paper, both raw and cleaned. 'Sripts' includes two scripts, one for importing data
(to be run first) and the other for data cleaning (to be run second).
