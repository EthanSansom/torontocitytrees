@article{Landry,
	abstract = {Environmental inequality is a phenomenon drawing much attention in the scientific and policy-making debates about urban forests and city greening. Most studies on the subject have shown that socially vulnerable, multicultural neighborhoods are disproportionately affected by the lack of urban forest while richer neighborhoods tend to be greener. But are there differences in the resilience of urban forests between poor and rich neighborhoods? We tackled this question using a newly developed indicator of urban forest resilience, functional diversity, to determine if environmental injustice is also found in the resilience of urban forests in poor neighborhoods. Using Canadian census data at the census tract scale, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and urban tree inventories, this study investigated if urban forest resilience is also part of the environmental inequality phenomenon in four urban areas in eastern Canada: Toronto, Gatineau-Ottawa, Montreal and Quebec City. Multivariate analysis of the dataset shows that urban forest functional diversity, used as an indicator of resilience, is inversely correlated to a set of variables associated with social vulnerability. The same relationship also exists with canopy cover; a pattern of inequality found in many cities around the world. With these findings, we show that social vulnerability and urban forest resilience are intertwined, meaning that neighborhoods already lacking urban forest are also more at risk of losing it due to a sudden environmental disturbance. When confronted with global change, considering this new insight into urban environmental inequality could be of great importance for maintaining a comfortable living environment for every city-dweller.},

@article{Graham,
	abstract = {Two thirds of Canadians reside in urban areas and 85% of recent population growth occurs in these areas. The intensity and duration of extreme hot weather events are predicted to increase in Canadian cities and in cities globally. It is well established that human suffering due to extreme heat is exacerbated in urban as compared to rural environments. Understanding the characteristics of urban landscapes that play the greatest roles in exacerbating the human health impact of extreme heat is thus imperative. This study explores the relationship between the amount of canopy cover from trees and the incidence of heat-related morbidity during extreme heat events in 544 neighbourhoods of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Four extreme heat events from three years were studied. Heat-related ambulance calls were found to be 12.3% higher during the heat events than in the preceding or the following week. The number of heat-related ambulance calls was negatively correlated to canopy cover (Spearman Rank rho=âˆ’0.094, p=0.029) and positively correlated to hard surface cover (Spearman Rank rho=0.150, p<0.001). Toronto neighbourhoods, as defined by Census Tracts, with less than 5% canopy cover had approximately five times as many heat-related calls as those with greater than 5% tree canopy cover, and nearly fifteen times as many heat-related calls as Census Tracts with greater than 70% tree canopy cover. These data suggest that even a marginal increase in the tree canopy cover from <5% to >5% could reduce heat-related ambulance calls by approximately 80%. These results have important implications for human health during heat events, particularly in the context of global climate change and urban heat islands, both of which are trending toward hotter urban environments in future.},

@article{Greene,
	abstract = {Urban tree canopy provides a suite of ecological, social, and economic benefits to the residents of urban areas. With an expanding recognition of these benefits among city residents, there is growing concern that access to these benefits is not distributed equally and may represent the presence of an environmental injustice. This study examines the spatial relationship between median household income and tree canopy variables, specifically realized tree canopy cover and potential tree canopy cover, for Toronto, Canada. Toronto provides a strong empirical focus as it is a densely populated urban setting reported to be exhibiting an increase in the geographic polarization of residents based upon household income. Spatial relationships between median household income and tree canopy variables are evaluated using the bivariate Moran's I statistic, a specialized local indicator of spatial autocorrelation (LISA). This method explicitly identified where statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low household income coincide with significant clusters of high and low urban tree canopy, providing the basis for an examination of the policies and management decisions that led to this temporal snapshot. The importance of these spatial clusters is examined from the perspective of understanding the impact of urban change (both socio-demographic and built form), and from the standpoint of improving equality of access to city trees and their benefits resulting from future tree planting decisions.},
